\section{Introduction}

\lettrine[nindent=0em,lines=3]{S} ince Alan Turing conceived his
universal machine in 1936, simple abstract automata have been studied. Interest broadened
beyond the theoretical realm in 1970,
when Conway published his \textit{Game of Life} simulations that highlighted the ability
of uncomplicated cellular automata to behave in complex ways. Researchers in the
nascent field of complexity theory also devoted attention to similar phenomena, such as the
"sandpile" first explored by Per Bak (true??).

In \textit{A New Kind of Science} (199?), Stephen Wolfram methodically analyzed
a variety of cellular automata types. His voluminous results cited particular inspiration from the
behavior of a one-dimensional machine running "Rule 110." Among his observations were... (list
irreducibility, etc.)

Wolfram and others have also suggested that some natural processes that were
previously thought to evolve by natural selection are instead
manifestations of things that nature found "easy" to accomplish using
the same fundamental principles that underlie simple automata.

In this work, we analyze a graph automaton -- a machine that operates on the same principles as
cellular automata, but runs using a graph rather than a "tape," or grid, as a substrate.
Where cellular machines define cell adjacency spatially, our machines use graph topology.

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Methods}

A rule-based automaton, \textbf{Machine C}, was designed and implemented in simulation.
The simulator was run repeatedly, using rules
selected at random from a large universe of possibilities. Measurements were recorded as the graphs
evolved through each run. The resulting database accumulated data on many thousands of runs. The body of data
was analyzed macroscopically, using aggregate
statistics, and microscopically, by inspecting statistical and graphic "snapshots" from individual runs.

Each simulation run begins with a randomly generated graph and progresses by
iteratively modifying its edges and node states; changes are made according to a rule selected
for the run. Each rule is effectively a simple program  that specifies, based on the state
of each node and its two topological neighbors, how local changes should be applied.

A simulation run proceeds as follows: (describe initial condition and iteration procedure)

\subsection{Graph Composition}

Nodes may be in one of two states: \textit{black} or \textit{white}.
Graph topology is narrowly restricted in order to simplify analysis:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Edges are directed.
    \item Nodes have out-degree of exactly two.
    \item Multiple, like-directed edges between two nodes are prohibited.
    \item "Self-linking" edges are permitted.
\end{itemize}

These conditions are established when creating initial graphs and maintained
throughout execution by "pruning" when necessary, as described in \textit{Structure Invariants}.

An initial, random graph of size N is constructed by assigning two edges to each node, with
the destination of each selected at random from all nodes, observing the
constraint that both edges cannot have the same destination node. As a consequence,
all nodes have out-degree 2, but in-degree can vary from 0 to N. Each node is assigned
a \textit{black} or \textit{white} state with equal likelihood.

\subsection{Machine \textbf{C} Rules and Operation}

A simulation run begins with an initial graph and proceeds through a series of
iterations; each iteration builds a new graph that reflects the state of the graph
with which it started, transformed according to the rule in force for the run.
As first produced, the transformed graph may contain prohibited structures
(like-directed edges between pairs of nodes). When this occurs, a pruning operation is
performed before proceeding to the next iteration. Pruning selectively removes
nodes and redirects edges until no prohibited structures remain.
The new graph, pruned as necessary, becomes the starting graph for the next iteration.
In some cases, pruning continues until the graph is empty, or "collapsed."
The simulation run ends when (1) the graph collapses, (2) a state cycle is detected,
or (3) the maximum number of iterations is reached.

For description purposes, we arbitrarily designate a node's two out-edges "left" and "right."
Rules consist of eight parts. Each rule-part specifies replacement values for
a node's state, the destination of its left out-edge, and the destination of its right
out-edge. Replacement destinations are given in terms of the node's current out-edge destinations
and those of its two immediate neighbors. Specifically, the six possible replacement
destinations are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item L - the node's current left-edge destination
    \item R - the node's current right-edge destination
    \item LL - the current destination of its left neighbor's left-edge
    \item LR - the current destination of its left neighbor's right-edge
    \item RL - the current destination of its right neighbor's left-edge
    \item RR - the current destination of its right neighbor's right-edge
\end{enumerate}

During an iteration, each node is examined in turn. Depending on the compound \textit{black}/\textit{white}
state of the node and its two neighbors, one of the eight rule-parts is applied to
the node's state and its two out-edges. Using the arbitrary designations of "left" and "right"
for the out-edges, the possible modifications are:
Combinatorics and packing.

\section{Results}

Initial graphs are finite, and graph size is either maintained
or reduced in each iteration. As a consequence, it is certain that all
simulations
would terminate with either a collapsed or a cycling graph if allowed to
run to completion. The simulator's ability to detect a state cycle is
limited, however, because a graph may traverse an astronomical
number of states before revisiting a previous configuration.
For this reason, a third, "unfinished" category is included in
outcome statistics.

\subsection{Rule-based vs. Random}

To gauge the extent to which machine \textbf{C} creates order out of
initially random graphs, a simulator for a second machine, \textbf{R},
was constructed. Like \textbf{C}, \textbf{R} makes iterative changes to the
graph, but proceeds by changing node states and edge assignments randomly
instead of under control of a rule. As with \textbf{C}, though, the scope
of \textbf{R}'s changes is confined to nodes' immediate topological neighborhoods.

Machine \textbf{C} is far less likely to produce graph collapses than
\textbf{R} (59.3\% vs. 99.9\% of runs). In cases where \textbf{C} produces
collapses, average run length is consistently greater than
for \textbf{R} (Fig. \ref{fig:fig1}.).

\begin{figure}
  \fbox{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth, scale=0.7]{fig1.png}}
  \caption{On average, the rule-based \textbf{C} machine executes more iterations than \textbf{R}  before collapse occurs.}
  \label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}

Other observations on how results from random Machine R differ.

\subsection{Unhappy Endings -- Cycles and Collapses}

All runs end in one of three ways... Graphs are finite. They begin
with n nodes and 2n edges and can only remain at their initial
size or grow smaller as iterations proceed.

For this one, we'll have to dust off the old self-organizing criticality
references. Are collapses like sandpile avalanches?
