# Degrees of Freedom in Network Automata Experiments

* Network Characteristics (directedness, fixed vs. variable degree, ...)
* "In" network vs. "on" network (can structure vary?, ...)
* Initial conditions (initial] net size and structure, trivial, random, ...)
* Mutables (node properties, edge properties, ...)
* Generation advancement scheme (copy-update-copy back, node-ordered, continuous & ordered, ...)
* Composition
* Juxtaposition
* Nesting
* Heterogeneity
* Evaluation of terminal net (general characterization, tree construction, ...)
