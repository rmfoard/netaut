- Toward a visualization toolset:
  - SNAP has a ~SaveGViz routine that writes a .dot file
  - SNAP also uses GnuPlot, according to my LabBook/AIDA notes
  - My AIDA LabBook notes record a .dot-to-.graphml converter find (yml reads .graphml)
  - neo4j is always a possibility
  - I found graph-tool to be the most useful, but cranky to install and use
  - ~/snap/snap-core/testSnap runs and produces .png output (once gnuplot was installed) They're statistical, though.
  - It may be instructive to examine testSnap.cpp, in the eponymous directory.
